    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>In 2016, I enrolled in Machakos University for a Bachelor's Degree in Education(Science), with Mathematics and Physics as my chosen teaching subjects. I had a difficult time choosing a major between Mathematics and Physics, since I was equally interested in both. However, after a lot of deliberation, I finally graduated in April of 2021 with a major in Physics.</p>
    <p>After graduation, I ended up working with Deaf Empowerment Kenya, an NGO based in Machakos. Through that and working directly with the local community, I gained a lot ok knowledge on matters Sexual and Reproductive Health, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, Rape and Post-Rape Emergency Medical Procedures, and Life Skills.</p>
    <h3>Why Programming?</h3>
    <p>I have always been interested with how things work and why they work the way that they do (I'm beginning to see why I chose Physics over Mathematics). "What makes the text 'blue'? How come when I click a 'blue-highlighted' text it takes me to a different page or section of a page? How did this picture get here?". Therefore when someone suggested I sign-up for a Software Development class, I did not hesitate.</p>
    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>Apart from being a teacher and a to-be-programmer, I have to say my one true passion is <strong>dancing</strong>...and <em>maybe</em> baking, when the products turn out right.</p>
