# Portfolio

#### By **Lilian Mutia**

A detailed personal portfolio. Includes my background, interests and projects.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Technologies Used
I used HTML and styled it using a custom-made stylesheet in CSS.
